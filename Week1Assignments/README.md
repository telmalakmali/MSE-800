Activity 1 : 13-04-25_Activity1.PY : My understanding,

Numpy is a library with in built predefined functions. 
throughout the code I will refer  the numpy library as np
I have used the variable first10 , to strore data for simplicity 
I have used numpy functions like arrange , shape and dtype in the code to fecth expected outputs.
np.arange(start, stop) generates numbers from start up to (but not including) stop

Numpy is a library with in built predefined functions. 
throughout the code I will refer  the numpy library as np
Variable scores is a 2D array where rows represent a student where columns represnts a subject 
I will get the avenrage of each student and each subject by using funtion "mean" and for this I have manually stored values for each student and subject in separete variables
Next was to identify the student index with highest score for that I will create variables for each student to sum the values for each subject and then get the max value by using "max" function then thriugh "argmax" function I get the index
Finally I have to add extra 5 points to the thrid subject , here I take the predefined variable for subject 3 and add 5 points using function "add"

Activity 3 : 13-04-25_Activity3.PY:  My understanding,

Numpy is a library with in built predefined functions. 
throughout the code I will refer  the numpy library as np
here I have used the variable temperatures and stores an array given values in this variable
then I utlize numpy functions like mean -to get the avergae of the array , min - to get the minumber value of the array , max-to get the maximum number of the array and where to appy a confdition
I have created anotehr variable named Fahrenheit to store the convereted values from celcius to fahrenheit 
the third and the fourth variables are named as Above20Ctemp and Above20Ctemp
in Above20Ctemp I will store the result where temperature is >20c but this will retun the array value with syntaxes
then in the Above20Ctemp im adding [0] as the indexing operator which will retun the result from the first satisfactory value in a much simplified way
